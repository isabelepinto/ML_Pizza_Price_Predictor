# Pizza Price Prediction Project

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts the price of a pizza based on its diameter. It uses a CSV file containing data on pizza diameters and their corresponding prices to train a linear regression model. This is my first machine learning project.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that can predict the price of a pizza given its diameter. The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on pizza diameters and prices.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for training.
3. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model using the prepared data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the model.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the price of a pizza based on its diameter.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in a CSV file named `pizza_data.csv`. The file contains two columns:
- `Diameter`: The diameter of the pizza in inches.
- `Price`: The price of the pizza in dollars.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)


## Results

The trained model will output the predicted price of a pizza based on its diameter. You can modify the script to input different diameters and see the corresponding predicted prices.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the basics of linear regression and how it can be used to make predictions based on simple data. It serves as a foundation for more complex machine learning projects in the future.
